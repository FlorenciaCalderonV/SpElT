# pyScan
### pyScan is a python-based toolkit for analysis of co-recorded electrophysiological and behavioural data, based on [scaNpix](https://github.com/LaurenzMuessig/scaNpix)
### Currently this is implemented for loading, processing and analysing raw data from Axona systems, with Neuropixels to be added soon
•	The package is based on Python 3.7, owing to several dependencies

•	Development by [Jake Swann](https://github.com/jakeswann1/) @ Wills-Cacucci Lab, UCL
